# MeatLoaf

In this directory are a collection of scripts I have developed to perform relatively simple weightlifting. The majority are small scripts that I've judged to be used more than once but by very few people.

There is no organization - think of it like one of those unkept thrift shops in the cool part of town. Maybe its all a load of junk... but maybe you'll find something that will work.

Welcome to MeatLoaf. It has a little bit of everything.
