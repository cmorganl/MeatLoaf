#MeatLoaf

In this directory are a collection of scripts I have developed to perform relatively simple weightlifting. The majority will those that I found useful outside of Coursera's Bioinformatics Algorithms course hosted by Pavel Pevzner and colleagues. Others, I have written for people, including myself, and think they may be useful to others as well. Welcome to MeatLoaf. It has a little bit of everything.
